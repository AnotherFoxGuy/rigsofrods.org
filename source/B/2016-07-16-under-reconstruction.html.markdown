Greetings all Rigs of Rods players and fans!  

First and foremost: The project is alive and healthy, no worries! You can check our GitHub repo or get in touch with devs on our Gitter channel. We're almost ready to make a new release and got plenty of plans and manpower to go further.
We're currently rebuilding our web infrastructure.  The former web page got very outdated and had to be closed due to security concerns.
A new website is currently under construction. All content from the old website has been archived and will be re-published on the new website, nothing gets lost.    

Stay tuned!
